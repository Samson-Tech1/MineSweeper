This is Minesweeper. This is my own take on the classic <a href="https://minesweeperonline.com"> MineSweeper</a> Game. Simply put, you start the game by running the code. Once the game has begun, click a square on the grid to either reveal a bomb, or a space. If you click on a space, the surrounding blocks may reavel how many bombs are in surrounding spaces. The objective of the game is to click all the empty spaces and <b>AVOID</b> all bombs. Customize the game board by changing the amount of bombs in the code given.
